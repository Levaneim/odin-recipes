# odin-recipes
My first TOP project.

The purpose of this project is to put my HTML knowledge that I have learnt so far into practice.

This is a basic recipe website.

End of project reflection.
This project allowed me to practice HTML to the point where I feel very confident with the basics. I got to practice git and made a couple mistakes along the way. I commited both the correct and incorrect version of one my .html pages to GitHub and had to delete the incorrect one.
