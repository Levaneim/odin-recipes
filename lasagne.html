    <ul>
        <li>1l milk</li>
        <li>1 brown onion</li>
        <li>8 parsley stalks</li>
        <li>8 whole pepeprcorns</li>

        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>60g butter</li>
        <li>70g parmesan</li>
        <li>pinch of nutmeg</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and 
            garlic and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until onion softens. Add the 
            mince and cook, stirring with a wooden spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 
            minutes or until mince changes colour. Add the tomato, wine and tomato paste, 
            and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 
            for 30 minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and season with 
            salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion, parsley stalks, peppercorns, 
            cloves and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from 
            heat and set aside for 15 minutes to infuse.</li>
        <li>Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard solids.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming. Add the flour and cook,
             stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until mixture bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan.
              Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon whisk, until mixture is smooth. 
            Gradually add the remaining milk, whisking until smooth and combined.</li>
        <li>Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, 
            for 5 minutes or until sauce thickens and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from heat. Add the parmesan 
            and stir until cheese melts. Taste and season with nutmeg, salt and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Brush a rectangular 3L (12 cup) capacity ovenproof dish with oil to lightly grease. 
            Spread one-quarter of the bechamel sauce over the base of the prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagne sheet over the 
            sauce. Top with one-third of the mince mixture and one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering 
            with the remaining lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a layer of bechamel. Sprinkle with 
            mozzarella. Place on a baking tray. Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, is golden brown, 
            and the edges are bubbling. Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes to set.</li>
        <li>Cut the lasagne into 8 portions and serve with mixed salad leaves.</li>
